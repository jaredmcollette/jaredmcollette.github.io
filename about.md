This is a personal website intended to blog about mathematics and cellular biology! I will be focusing on topics include finite-element methods, continuum mechanics, reaction diffusion, transport phenomena, signal transduction, systems biology, and more!

I will be pulling examples from the finite-element software FEniCS. You can find the webpage for FEniCS at:
[FEniCS][fenics-organization]

A test equation is:
$$ x = y^2 $$
