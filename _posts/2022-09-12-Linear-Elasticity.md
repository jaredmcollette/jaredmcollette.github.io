## 1D Linear Elasticity

## 2D Linear Elasticity

The 2D equations of Linear Elasticity are given by:

$$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{E} \left[ (1 + \nu)\sigma - \nu I tr(\sigma) \right] $$

$$ \lambda tr(\varepsilon) I + 2\mu\varepsilon $$

$$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla u + \nabla u ^T \right)
